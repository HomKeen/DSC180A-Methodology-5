### Answers to questions
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**<br>
Our professor didn't especially inform us on applications of causal learning; it was mostly focused on theory and algorithms for general use cases. I think that she wasn't aware that 180A involved completing a project, and that it was just a normal lecture class to prepare us for the project in 180B.<br><br>
We went straight from that into picking topics for our Q1 projects, so I'm afraid the only topic covered was the topic that our group picked- causal analysis of Earth's climate as a dynamical system. Professor Huang did support us in exploring this topic, by sending us some papers related to our chosen topic. To this end, analyzing climate change by identifying the factors that cause it has been very intriguing, since this is such a pressing issue. Specifically identifying the *causes* with causal learning offers an alternative approach than running a full physical simulation (the current method of analyzing causes) which is very difficult and costly.

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**<br>
I would like to use some sort of machine learning approach to causal learning. All of the methods taught to us by Professor Huang have been statistical methods, but given the large amount of data, we can definitely train a ML model instead. This is especially interesting because climate data dynamical systems are high-dimensional and nonlinear, preventing us from using many statistical methods that must rely on assumptions (e.g., that relationships are linear, or that noise is normally distributed). A suitably complex ML model may be able to identify causes, causal directions, and causal strength all while making minimal assumptions.

- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br>
One of our issues is data availability, since the research paper that we are recreating takes 7 datasets from different sources, some of which are hidden behind paywalls or require us to contact the authors (none of whom have responded). This will inevitably introduce some error into our reproduced project, as the missing variables must then be classified as extraneous. One workaround that I would like to see is to seek the same data from a different source, and hope that the data was measured as well as in the original paper, however we may be too far into the Q1 project to do so. However, we definitely should not cut any corners in the Q2 project.

- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
I'm mostly interested in seeing some type of machine learning technique applied to the project. For example, maybe a recursive neural network (RNN) is best applicable since we are using time series data. We could possibly combine this with standard time series modelling such as ARIMA
